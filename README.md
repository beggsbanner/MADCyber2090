# MADCyber2090
This is the game that I am coding to learn as much python coding as possible in the shortest amount of time, along with learning Cybersecurity. The goal is to create a Final Fantasy type, turn based RPG that includes normal game play, but incorporates all aspects needed to learn cybersecurity and take the Security+ exam.
